# spring-rabbitmq-messaging
Example project showing how to build a scalable microservice architecture using Spring Boot &amp; RabbitMQ

WeÂ´re using [RabbitMQ Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/) here. So if you fire it up with `docker-compose up -d`, you can easily login to the management gui at http://localhost:15672 using `guest` & `guest` as credentials.
